By default, combobox (as dropdown and multiselect ) height is defined at 50% of viewport vertical size. If list exceeds this value, a scrollbar appear. Of course it is a maximum size.
It is possible to redefine this size with **scrollHeight** parameter.

```ts
<p-dropdown>
  <scrollHeight="50vh">
</p-dropdown>
```

```ts
</p-multiSelect>
  <scrollHeight="50vh">
</p-multiSelect>
```
