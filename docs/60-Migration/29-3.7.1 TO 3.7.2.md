# Framework from v3.7.0 to v3.7.1

## AUTOMATIC MIGRATION
 
1. Use the BIAToolKit to migrate the project

2. Manage the conflict (2 solutions)
   1. In BIAToolKit click on "4 - merge Rejected" and search `<<<<<` in all files.  
    * Resolve the conflict manually.
   2. Analyze the .rej file (search "diff a/" in VS code) that have been created in your project folder
     * Apply manually the change.

3. Change source path and run the script [V3.7.1_to_V3.7.2_Replacement.ps1](./Scripts/V3.7.1_to_V3.7.2_Replacement.ps1)

4. Apply other manual step (describe bellow) at the end if all is ok, you can remove the .rej files (during the process they can be useful to resolve build problem)
