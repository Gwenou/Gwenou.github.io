# Plan the application development

## Specify with mockup
Firstly, the business should be consult to understand the need:
- **Screen mockups** will be design. 
- The mockups will be challenge to match as much as possible with **standard component** of the framework. (CRUD, Form, Graph and Prime NG component)

## Estimate the cost
After the agreement with the business, the calculation of the cost can be estimate:
- Study all screen and determine the component needed, back compute service to code, and complexity of the data model. For every item, a level of complexity is determinate.
- The build cost will be compute in an **estimation matrix**. In this matrix, every item have a cost regarding there complexity.
- Additional cost will be add by percentage of the “build cost” this percentage will be adapt by return of experience on older project.
- The result should be share with project manager to **plan the development**.
